# ticTacToe Game

This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript DOM. Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player board game with the objective of achieving a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with three matching marks (X or O).

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. There are three game modes:
   - Play against a bot using the "X" symbol.
   - Play against a bot using the "O" symbol.
   - Play against a friend in a turn-based mode.
3. The first player will use the "X" symbol, and the second player will use the "O" symbol.
4. The game ends when one player achieves a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with three matching symbols, or when all cells are filled (a draw).
5. You can start a new game by clicking the "Reset" button below the game board.
